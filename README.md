# 👋 Hey, I'm Rahul Nainala

**Full-Stack Engineer** | Distributed Systems | Scalable Architecture | Currently: 3+ Years Production Experience

📍 Hyderabad, India | 💼 Building systems that scale | 🎯 Joining FAANG in 2026

## What I Do

I design and ship production-grade **backend systems** that power real users at scale. I think in terms of:
- System architecture and distributed system trade-offs
- Database optimization and query performance
- REST APIs and async processing
- Frontend-to-backend integration (full-stack mindset)

**Right now**: Deep diving into system design, mastering PostgreSQL optimization, solving 380+ LeetCode problems

## 🔧 My Approach to Problems

1. **Understand the constraints**: Scale, latency, consistency requirements
2. **Design with trade-offs**: No silver bullets (SQL vs NoSQL, sync vs async, etc.)
3. **Code for production**: Testing, monitoring, error handling from day 1
4. **Measure everything**: Metrics > assumptions
5. **Communicate clearly**: Document decisions, make them discoverable
